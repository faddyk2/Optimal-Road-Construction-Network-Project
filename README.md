# Optimal-Road-Construction-Network-Project
This project aims to calculate the minimum cost or optimal road construction network using Prim's Algorithm. The application provides a user-friendly interface for inputting city names, distances, and obstacle costs to determine the most cost-effective road network construction plan.

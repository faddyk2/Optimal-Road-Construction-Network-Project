# Minimum Cost Road Construction Network using Prim's Algorithm

## Description
This project aims to calculate the minimum cost or optimal road construction network using Prim's Algorithm. The application provides a user-friendly interface for inputting city names, distances, and obstacle costs to determine the most cost-effective road network construction plan.

## Features
- Input City Names: Users can input city names for road construction.
- Distance Calculation: Utilizes Puppeteer to scrape distance data between cities.
- Obstacle Costs: Users can specify obstacle costs such as mountains, rivers, residential areas, and forests.
- Prim's Algorithm Visualization: Visualizes the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Prim's Algorithm.
- Undo Functionality: Allows users to undo previous actions.
- Dynamic Auto-Complete: Auto-completion for city names to enhance user experience.

## Technologies Used
- Language: C#
- Framework: .NET Framework
- Algorithm: Prim's Algorithm
- Scraping Tool: Puppeteer
- External APIs: None

## How to Use
1. Launch the application.
2. Input city names in the designated fields.
3. Specify obstacle costs if applicable (mountains, rivers, residential areas, forests).
4. Utilize Puppeteer to scrape distance data between cities.
5. View the minimum cost road construction network visualization generated by Prim's Algorithm.
6. Undo actions if necessary.
7. Analyze the total cost after Prim's Algorithm optimization.
